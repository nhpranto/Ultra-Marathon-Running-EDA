 # Ultra-Marathon Running Data Analysis

This project analyzes ultra-marathon running data using Python.
The goal is to understand race performance and participation by exploring the data and creating clear visualizations.

This project shows my ability to work with real data, find patterns, and explain results in a simple way.

# Project Overview

Ultra-marathons are long-distance running events that test endurance.
In this project, I explore race data to answer basic questions like:

How do finishing times vary?

What patterns appear in ultra-marathon races?

What can we learn from the data using charts and statistics?

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, focused on understanding the data.

# What This Project Shows

Cleaning and preparing real-world data

Exploring data using statistics and charts

Creating clear and easy-to-read visualizations

Writing organized and readable analysis code

Turning raw data into useful insights

# What I Did

Loaded and reviewed the dataset

Fixed missing or inconsistent values

Used basic statistics to understand the data

Created simple charts to show trends and patterns

Explained findings step by step in the notebook

# Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook


Open the notebook and run the cells in order.

# Why This Project Is Useful

This project shows skills that are important for data analyst roles, including:

Working with real datasets
